# Voronoi Scatter

Once you install the Scattershot addon, you'll find a new operator called Voronoi Scatter in the Node menu of the Shader Editor. To access it more quickly, right quick and add it to your quick favorites (Q) menu or use the right click context menu.

[!NOTE]
Note: the right click context menu does not show the addon's settings - it will use the default or last used settings.

You must have one or more image textures selected in order to use the Voronoi Scatter command. The tooltips for the settings are pretty descriptive, so hover your mouse over each button if you forget what it does. Click 'OK' and your textures will be converted into a scatter node.

If you would like to change your scatter node's settings after the fact, such as to switch from UV to tri-planar mapping, select just the scatter node and run the Voronoi Scatter operator again.

To reverse the process, you can always select the scatter node and use the Un-Scatter command that is in the Node menu or in the right click context menu.
