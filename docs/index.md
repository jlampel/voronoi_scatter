# Scattershot Intro

Scattershot is an addon for Blenderâ€™s shader editor that distributes and randomizes textures, similar to texture bombing or splattering operations in other 3d software, except with more control and less setup.

You can download Scattershot by purchasing it on the Blender Market or by subscribing to CG Cookie. The code for Scattershot is freely avaliable to view on GitHub but the node groups that it depends on are not included.
